# adaptive-speed-controller

This Jupyter Notebook simulates the behavior of a lead vehicle and multiple following vehicles in a traffic flow scenario using adaptive speed control. The model incorporates key parameters such as acceleration gain (α) and desired time gap (τ) to create the simulations and assess the safety. The code levereages numpy and matplotlib to compute and visualize the simulations.
